                <h2>David Chambat</h2>
                <h3>Managing Director & Founder</h3>
                <p class="hidden-xs">David’s job is to make sure that you have the best possible experience when you search, book and stay in one of our villas. Being extremely customer-focused, he insists on talking to clients directly on the phone and personally visiting each of the villas in our collection.</p>
                <p class="hidden-xs">David started the company in 2012 when he realized that booking a villa was still a challenging thing to do. A native of France, he has been living in Asia since 1997 and has worked for Air France-KLM and the hotel website TVtrip.com. He is a graduate from EDHEC and holds an MBA from INSEAD. A keen runner and a passionate yogi, he currently lives in Singapore and has 3 kids.</p>

A die hard on ensuring the quality, delivery and security of our websites, he hunts down any inelegant syntax in our code. A graduate in Information Technology from Bordeaux University, France, Laurent previously worked for Virgin Mobile, Saint-Gobain (construction materials) and myVideoProfile (on demand sport video) before moving to Singapore in 2015.</p>

The only thing he enjoys more than traveling around the world is playing the devil’s advocate in our meetings.</p>

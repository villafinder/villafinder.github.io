Sun-soakers, snorkelers and scuba divers love the sandy white beaches and its beautiful corals underneath. The rest of Phuket are mostly covered in forest and rubber and palm oil plantations – lots of greenery that will soothe your tired eyes. Although a fast-growing tourist industry, Phuket has a rather traditional and slower pace of life that tourists enjoy taking a break in from their hectic lives.</p>
